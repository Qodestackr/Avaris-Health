# Avaris Health  
### *"When Stockouts, Counterfeits, and NHIF’s PDFs Try to End You"*  

---

Pharmacies in Kenya are fighting three plagues: **stockouts**, **fake drugs**, and **spreadsheets that should have retired with Internet Explorer**. Avaris Health is an AI toolkit that:  
1. **Predicts Stockouts**: Like a weather app, but for amoxicillin. Just don’t expect it to find Panadol when stress-buying season hits.
2. **Spots Counterfeit Meds**: Trained on blurry WhatsApp photos of *“genuine fake”* packaging. Yes, even those ones from your supplier who swears "ni original tu bana".
3. **Sends SOS Alerts**: “Boss, we’re out of paracetamol” → auto-texts your supplier (and your ex, by accident).

## **Why Bother?**  
- **USAID’s Ghost**: Their funding vanished, but malaria didn’t.  
- **NHIF’s PDFs**: If you’ve ever tried parsing a scanned table from 1998, you’ll understand.  
- **Fanta Crisis**: No, the orange drink isn’t a deworming med. *But the AI thinks it is.*

## **Features (Mostly Work)**  
| Feature | Description | ... |  
|---------|-------------|---------------|  
| **AI Inventory Prophet** | Predicts when malaria meds will vanish. | Still confused by your 'misc' Excel column |  
| **Counterfeit Catcher** | Scans drug packaging via WhatsApp. | Accurate, unless the photo includes someone’s lunch. |  
| **M-Pesa Roulette** | Auto-reorders meds via Safaricom’s API. | Works 60% of the time. |  
| **NHIF Whisperer** | Exports reports for gov’t audits. | *“Converts PDFs to CSV. Not responsible for existential dread.”* |
